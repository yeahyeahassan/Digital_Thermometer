## ⚙️ Working of Digital Thermometer

1. **Temperature Sensing:** The LM35 temperature sensor produces voltage in direct proportion to the temperature. It contains two transistors; one has an emitter area ten times greater than the other, causing a current reduction. The voltage across the transistor's resistance correlates with absolute temperature, which is converted to Celsius using an in-built amplifier.
2. **Response to Heat:** When a finger is placed over the LM35 temperature sensor, the voltage across the diode increases in response to the temperature rise. This voltage change is due to the generated voltage across the transistor's base and emitter.
3. **Calibration:** The potentiometer serves as a calibrating tool, set according to the room temperature during reading.
4. **Analog to Digital Conversion:** A CA3162 4-bit ADC is used to convert the analog signal from the temperature sensor to a corresponding BCD code. A potentiometer connected to the 8th and 9th pins of this IC controls the voltage across it.
5. **Display:** The 74LS47 interface IC converts the generated BCD code into a pattern for a seven-segment display to show the temperature in Celsius. Three seven-segment displays are connected to three 2n3906 transistors, which switch between MSB, NSB, and LSB for display.

In summary, when a finger is placed on the sensor, a corresponding voltage is produced, converted to a BCD code, and then displayed on a seven-segment display through an interface IC.
